# Kiwiibot but in typescript
Kiwiibot, but in typescript 'cause I was bored

This is just a refactored version in typescript of [Kiwiibot](https://github.com/Rapougnac/Kiwiibot)
I know that I have many errors I the code, but I coded like a dumb in javascript.

## Installation

1) Clone this repo

2)
- **On Windows**
Run __as admin__ powershell, then do the following command
```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
Now, move to the directory of the bot, e.g
```bash
cd path/to/folder
```
And then, you can write
```ps1
.\setup.ps1
```
Once it's done, you can re-set the execution policy to restricted (default)
```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
```
And you're ready to go!



- **On Linux**
Go to the directory of the bot, and then, type
```bash
./setup.sh
```
And you're redy to go!
